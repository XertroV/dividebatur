## Usage
./run\_aec\_fed2013\_wa.sh will run a count of the Fed2013 WA Senate count 
using data from the first count of ballots.  The data for these tests is in 
the repository under fed2013\_wasenate1/data

./update.sh will pull down the data needed for a WA count from the AEC

## Structure
senatecount.py builds up the initial data needed to begin the count, and then hands it to counter.py

counter.py processes the vote. Note it may require user input to break ties which occur choosing a candidate 
to exclude, choosing the order of election, or choosing the final candidate elected.
