For Ubuntu:

Git Large File Support:

$ mkdir -p $HOME/bin
$ wget https://github.com/github/git-lfs/releases/download/v1.3.0/git-lfs-linux-amd64-1.3.0.tar.gz
$ tar xvfz git-lfs-linux-amd64-1.3.0.tar.gz

$ export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin/
```

# Optional to run tests
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip
$ pip3 install flake8
$ pip3 install nose
```

## Usage

`git lfs pull` will download the large data files.

`./run_aec_fed2013_wa.sh` will run a count of the 2013/14 WA Senate count .
The data is in the repository under `aec_data/fed2013_wa`.

`./run_aec_fed2016.sh` will run a count for all states with data available,
for the 2016 federal election. The data is in the repository under `aec_data/fed2016`.

## Structure
senatecount.py builds up the initial data needed to begin the count, and then hands it to counter.py

counter.py processes the vote. Note it may require user input to break ties which occur choosing a candidate 
to exclude, choosing the order of election, or choosing the final candidate elected.
